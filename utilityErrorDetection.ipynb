    "## Anomaly Detection Algorithms to Choose From\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/5-anomaly-detection-algorithms-every-data-scientist-should-know-b36c3605ea16\n",
    "Depends on what kind of anomalies exist in our data:\n",
    "- Outliers: Short/small anomalous patterns that appear in a non-systematic way in data collection.\n",
    "- Change in Events: Systematic or sudden change from the previous normal behavior.\n",
    "- Drifts: Slow, undirectional, long-term change in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Point anomalies – if a data point is too far from the rest, it falls into the category of point anomalies. The above example of bank transaction illustrates point anomalies.\n",
    "Contextual anomalies – If the event is anomalous for specific circumstances (context), then we have contextual anomalies. As data becomes more and more complex, it is vital to use anomaly detection methods for the context. This anomaly type is common in time-series data. Example – spending $10 on ice-cream every day during the hot months is normal, but is odd for the rest months.\n",
    "Collective anomalies. The collective anomaly denotes a collection of anomalous with respect to the whole dataset, but not individual objects. Example: breaking rhythm in ECG (Electrocardiogram).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not using simple statistical methods like comparing mean and median because our data is not univariate. Typos/errors can occur in the cost or consumption columns, so we need to choose a method that can take this into account. In addition, natural dips and peaks that are typical for that account could be marked as outliers if we were to do simple comparisons. A machine learning approach will take into account the historical context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simple statistical techniques such as mean, median, quantiles can be used to detect univariate anomalies feature values in the dataset. Various data visualization and exploratory data analysis techniques can be also be used to detect anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project originated from my work with naval utility data, which contained electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer along with over 4000 different accounts and line item descriptions to take into account. Since this data is sensitive, I've recreated the assignment using NYC utility data, which only contains electricity and about 300 accounts. The NYC data is also cleaned an doesn't contain any errors, so I artificially introduced some errors into the data (approx 5% of the data will contain errors). The original dataset where I was working with all naval utilities worldwide had much more errors because we dealt with a lot of manual data entry. We also had bill corrections which this data does not contain. This data comes directly from the electricity meter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Checklist:\n",
    "1. Isolation Forest\n",
    "   1. Chose isolation forest because it is easy to interpret for our stakeholders\n",
    "2. Local Outlier Factor\n",
    "3. Robust Covariance\n",
    "4. One-Class SVM\n",
    "5. One-Class SVM (SGD)\n",

    "More Anomaly Info:\n",
    "https://serokell.io/blog/anomaly-detection-in-machine-learning\n",
    "- We are dealing with contextual outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Unsupervised: don't actually know what is is/isnt an error\n",
    "- Flexible/robust enough to account for data changes\n",
    "- Interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at only variance and standard deviations assumes that all groups will behave the same and doesn't take into account context of the account\n",
    "Rule based analysis where we are looking at vaue thresholds assume we know what an acceptable range is. What happens when we have new data? How we take that into account? Do we have to create rules for every single group? Unwieldy for large datasets and not sustainable in the long-run\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-NN algorithm works very well for dynamic environments where frequent updates are needed. In addition, density-based distance measures are good solutions for identifying unusual conditions and gradual trends. This makes k-NN useful for outlier detection and defining suspicious events.\n",
    "k-NN also is very good techniques for creating models that involve non-standard data types like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "k-NN is one of the proven anomaly detection algorithms that increase the fraud detection rate. It is also one of the most known text mining algorithms out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The LOF is a key anomaly detection algorithm based on a concept of a local density. It uses the distance between the k nearest neighbors to estimate the density.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF compares the local density of an item to the local densities of its neighbors. Thus one can determine areas of similar density and items that have a significantly lower density than their neighbors. These are the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering\n",
    "- Only works with numeric data - we have some categorical cols\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series\n",
    "- Not using this because we are taking into account more than just the numeric values. We want to feed in the vendor, location, rate type because anomalies could be specific to groups within these variables\n",
